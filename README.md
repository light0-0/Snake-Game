# Snake-Game
Welcome to Snake, the classic game reimagined in Java! In this game, you control the snake as it navigates through the map, collecting apples to grow longer and score points. But be careful - if you crash into your own tail, it's game over! Otherwise, the game goes on indefinitely. Can you beat your own high score?

# How to play
Playing Snake is easy:

Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
Collect apples to grow longer and score points.
Avoid crashing into the walls or your own tail, or it's game over.
The game goes on indefinitely, so see how long you can last and try to beat your own high score.
